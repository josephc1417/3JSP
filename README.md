# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

- --legacy-peer-deps 
- @react-three/fiber -react base 3JS library that allows us to create 3JS code in a react fasion
- @react-three/drei maath - for math utility function (Geometry)
- react-tilt- this will provide animations when hovering over cards
- react-vertical-timeline-component - for the UI experience similar to the linked-in experience 
- @emailjs/browser
- framer-motion
- react-router-dom

## Assets and Files that were pre-made to make the coding workflow a bit simpler

### Google Drive- Add files through the Windows 
- Zipped Public Folder - delete current public folder and paste new folder in root of directory 

- Zipped Components Folder - these will just be empty structures that we will fill in as we go along 

- Zipped Assets Folder -delete assets folder and copy and paste the new one

- Delete App.css file
- Modify App.jsx file
